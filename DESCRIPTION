Description: Here we propose a model to systematically analyze the roles of architectural proteins and functional elements in blocking long-range contacts between loci. The proposed model does not rely on topologically associating domain (TAD) mapping from Hi-C data. Instead of testing the enrichment or influence of protein binding at TAD borders, the model directly estimates the blocking effect of proteins on long-range contacts between flanking loci, making the model intuitive and biologically meaningful.
